# MOS_6502_CPU
This project is a simulation of the MOS 6502 CPU, implemented in C++. The MOS 6502 was a revolutionary microprocessor in the late 1970s and is still popular in retrocomputing and emulation communities. The goal of this project is to provide a brief, functional, and modular C++ implementation of the CPU.
